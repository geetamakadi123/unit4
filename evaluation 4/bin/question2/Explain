Q2) Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.
Ans:
The equals() and hashcode() are the two important methods provided by the Object class for comparing objects.

The java equals() is a method of lang.Object class, and it is used to compare two objects.

To compare  two objects that they are to be same, it compares the values of both the objects attributes.

Two objects will be the same only if stored in the same memory location.

A hashcode is an integer value assosicate with every object in java facilitates the hashing in hash tables.

To get this hashcode value for an object, we can use the hashcode() method in java. 

It is the hashcode method that returns the integer hashcode value of the given object.

Since this hashcode method is defined in the object class, hence it is integrated by userdefinded classes also.

Java hashcode() and equals() method are used in hash table based on implementations in java ofr storing and receiveing the data. 
The Java equals() and hashcode method should follow this rules;

If a1.equals(a2), then a1.hashcode() == a2.hashcode()
should be true always.

If a1.hashcode() == a2.hashcode is true, it doesn't means that 
a1.equals(a2) will be also true.


When override equals() method it is mostly necessary to override the hashCode() method, too so that hashCode() is not be implement necessary.


We can define our own equals() and hashCode() method implementation but if we do not implement them carefully, then it can have issue creating in runtime.
