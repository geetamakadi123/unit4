Question 2:
Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples.

Ans: Connecting a method call to the method body is known as Binding.
 There are two type of Binding:
 
 1. Early Binding 
 2. Late Binding
 
 1. When the type of an object is determined at compile time it is known as early Binding,
  whereas when a type of the object is determined at run-time it is known as Late Binding.
 In java each variable has a type it may be static , private method in a class, there is a static binding,
 
 class Dog{
 private void eat(){
 
 System.out.println("dog is eating");
 
 }
 public static void main(String[] args){
 Dog d1 = new Dog();
 d1.eat();
 }
 
 Late binding:
 
 when type of the object is determined at run-time, it's known as late binding.
 
 class Animal{
 void eat(){
  System.out.println("animal is eating");
  }
 }
 
 class Dog extends Animal{
 void eat(){
  System.out.println("dog is eating");
  }
  public static void main(Strings args){
  
  Animal a1 = new Dog();
  a1.eat();
  }
  
  }
