Q3) What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ? Explain with an example.
Answer:
super keyword will represent the immediate parent class object.
this keyword represents the current class object.



Following 3 main job of this keyword:
        1. Points to the current class obj.
        2. Differentiate between local and instance variable.
        3. Calling a constructor of a class from another constructor of the same class.

 
 By super keyword calling the method of parent class and calling the
constructor of the parent class is entirely different.
Constructor call must be the first statement while method call can be any place.


We can not use super and this keyword inside the static area.


Example:

A.java:
-----------
package com.masai;

public class A {
	
	int i=10;
	

	void funA() {
		
		System.out.println("inside funA of A");
	}
