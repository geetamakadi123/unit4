Q4) Explain the Q.difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?

Ans:

1. Method Overloading
Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program.
Method overloading is performed within class.
In case of method overloading, parameter must be different.
Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism.
In java, method overloading can't be performed by changing return type of the method only.
Return type can be same or different in method overloading.
But you must have to change the parameter.

Example :
class OverloadingExample{
	static int add(int a,int b){
	  return a+b;
	  }
	static int add(int a,int b,int c){
	  return a+b+c;
	  }
}

2. Method Overriding
Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of the method
that is already provided by its super class.
Method overriding occurs in two classes that have IS-A (inheritance) relationship.
