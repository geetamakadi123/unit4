Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Ans: Static Variable
 A static variable is also called a class variable and is common across the objects of the class and this variable can be accessed using the class name as well.

 Non-static Variable
Any variable of a class which is not static is called non-static variable or an instance variable.


Example of static vs non-static variable
JavaTester.java
public class JavaTester {
   public int counter = 0;
   public static int staticCounter = 0;
   public JavaTester(){
      counter++;
      staticCounter++;
   }
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      JavaTester tester = new JavaTester();
      JavaTester tester1 = new JavaTester();
      JavaTester tester2 = new JavaTester();
      System.out.println("Counter: " + tester2.counter);
      System.out.println("Static Counter: " + tester2.staticCounter);
   }
}
