Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?

Array:
An array is a dynamically-created object. It serves as a container that holds the
constant number of values of the same type. It has a contiguous memory location.
Array is static in size. An array is a fixed-length data structure.It is mandatory
to provide the size of an array while initializing it directly or indirectly.It
performs fast in comparison to ArrayList because of fixed size.Array provides a
length variable which denotes the length of an array.

Example of Array:
public class ArrayExample
{
public static void main(String args[])
	{
	//creating an array of integer type
	int arr[]=new int[4];
	//adding elements into array
	arr[0]=12;
	arr[1]=2;
	arr[2]=15;
	arr[3]=67;
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
	{
	System.out.println(arr[i]);
	}
  }
}
//output
12
2
15
67

ArrayList:
The ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework. It contains popular classes
like Vector, HashTable, and HashMap.ArrayList is dynamic in size.ArrayList is a
variable-length data structure. It can be resized itself when needed.We can create
an instance of ArrayList without specifying its size. Java creates ArrayList of default size.
ArrayList is internally backed by the array in Java. The resize operation in ArrayList
slows down the performance.ArrayList provides the size() method to determine the size of ArrayList.

Example of ArrayList

public class ArrayListExample
{
public static void main(String args[])
	{
	//creating an instance of ArrayList
	List<Float> list = new ArrayList<Float>();
	//adding element to arraylist
	list.add(45.4f);
	list.add(56.6f);
	list.add(67.8f);
	list.add(78.9f);
	//iteration over ArrayList using for-each loop
	for(Float f:list)
	{
	System.out.println(f);
	}
  }
}

output
45.4
56.6
67.8
78.9
